	<h1>Paris</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Paris (English: /ˈpærɪs/; French pronunciation: ​
		[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of
		France, with an official estimated population of 2,102,650 
		residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than
		105 km² (41 sq mi),[5] making it the fourth-most populated 
		city in the European Union as well as the 30th most densely
		populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century,
		Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, 
		diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For
		its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as "the City of Light".[7] Like London, prior to the Second World War,
		it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.</p>
